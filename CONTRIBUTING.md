Thanks heaps for being interested in contributing to python-bibtexparser.

We are always looking for people to improve the library. Contributions include, but are not limited to:

1. Opening well described issues for bugs or feature requests.
2. Providing bugfixing PRs
3. Implementing any of the issues or continuing any of the PRs labelled with `needs help` or `good first issue`.

Some guidelines:

1. Be nice! Were all doing this in our free time; no one is obligated to do anything.
2. Add sufficient tests to your PRs 
3. Document your code.
4. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

Also note that there are currently two independent "default" branches: 
First, `master`, where we maintain a stable `v1.x` and where we merge almost only backwards-compatible bugfixes.
Second, `v2` where we work on a full re-implementation of the library. 

Issues targeting the `v2` branch are labelled `v2`.
