History and evolutions
----------------------

The original source code was part of bibserver from `OKFN <http://github.com/okfn/bibserver>`_. This project is released under the AGPLv3. OKFN and the original authors kindly provided the permission to use a subpart of their project (ie the bibtex parser) under LGPLv3. Many thanks to them!

The parser evolved to a new core based on pyparsing.

News (July 7h, 2022): This library has a new maintainer (`@MiWeiss <https://github.com/MiWeiss>`_).
Versions 1.x will be mostly bugfixes and maintenance.
In the meantime, we are working on a new version 2.0.0 which will be a complete rewrite of the library.
