Requirements
------------

Bibtexparsers only requirement is a python interpreter which is not yet EOL (currently >= 3.7).

As of version 2.0.0, bibtexparser is a pure-python project (no direct bindings to C libraries).
As such, it should be rather easy to install on any platform.


Installation from PyPI
--------------------------

To install the latest release candidate (currently required to use v2) using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install --pre bibtexparser

without the ``--pre`` option, you will get the latest `v1` version.
It has a different API and is not directly compatible with v2.


Installation from source
----------------------------

Download the source from `Github <https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser/>`_.
Navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install .

Or, if you want to install dev dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install .[test,lint,docs]
