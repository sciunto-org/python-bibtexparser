BibtexParser is a python library to parse bibtex files. The code relies on `pyparsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_ and is tested with unittests.

If you use BibtexParser for your project, feel free to send me an email. I would be happy to hear that and to mention your project in the documentation.
