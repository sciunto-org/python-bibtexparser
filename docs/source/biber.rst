Biber & Biblatex
================


Due to its simple and high-level nature, this library should not only support BibTeX, but also be able to parse biblatex and biber files
with ease, as they all share the same general syntax.

That said, we did not explicitly check against all of biber and biblatex features. Should you detect anything which is not supported,
please open an issue or send a pull request.
