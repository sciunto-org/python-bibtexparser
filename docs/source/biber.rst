Biber & Biblatex
================


Due to its simpel and high-level nature, this library should not only support BibTeX, but also be able to part biblatex and biber files
with ease, as they all share the same general syntax.

That said, we did not explicitely check against all of biber and biblatex features. Should you detect anything which is not supported,
please open an issue or send a pull request.
